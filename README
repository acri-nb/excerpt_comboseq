# Piror to running exceRpt, please verify that excerpt_in is soft-linked or sshfs binded to the appropriate input dir
# Also please specify full output dir path as second arg. 
# Input dirs should contain the fastq files to be processed. COMBOseq fastqs are second-strand sequenced. 
# Illumina is FS sequences, therefore any smRNA pushed through exceRpt should be sense for comboseq and antisens for illumina

# exceRpt is currently run from a docker image requiring sudo privileges. 
# The command for batch input is:

nohup sudo bash -c 'for i in `ls excerpt_in/*.fq | cut -f2 -d '/' `; do ./excerpt.sh $i <outDir>; done' &

# Followed by a helper script to merge counts into a RData object. 

Rscript mergePipelineRuns.R <outDir>

# Afterwards, the following command can be run to summarize results. 

R -e "rmarkdown::render('exceRpt_DGE_rmd.Rmd')" --args excerpt_out/exceRpt_smallRNAQuants_ReadCounts.RData Design_template_1.txt 2 Responder Progression

# The arguments are 1 - the RData object from the merge script, 2 - The phenotype data table, 3 - The low-count filter (in CPM), 4 - the reference factor level, 5 - the treatment factor level.
# Using the counts from the excerpt_out folder, the supplied design matrix, the filter (CPM) and the reference and treatment levels, a HTML markdown is created.  
# Please refer to user eallain for any questions / details
